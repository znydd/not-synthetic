The instructor explains the rules for the upcoming group presentation, divides the students into groups, takes attendance, and addresses various student questions related to the assignment and group formations. This entire portion deviates from the academic subject of the lecture.",
    "subtitle": "and then what are we going to do for a webinar presentation in English 091? First I'm going to divide you into four groups not five groups four groups. Then you will see there are four articles on buX and I will assign one article to each group. Then, every participant will present the different main ideas or components of the article. So let's say this is a long article, right? This is probably an article of let's say 10 or 15 paragraphs, alright because the length of the article will vary. You you will see that. So you are not going to since it's a group presentation so not that everybody is going to do the presentation on the whole article. We you will follow a special reading strategy that is called jigsaw strategy. So in jigsaw strategy what we do is there are group there are group members in one group right? So you will divide the long text or the long article into chunks or parts. Then each group member will take only one part or one chunk of the article. So let's say if there are since there are 25 students, so there are going to be six students in one group. Only one group will have seven students. So let's say if there are 15 paragraphs then you can divide the paragraphs by like this. Like one person will present on two paragraphs. So if there are 15 paragraphs then you know if there are seven group members then each of them will get two paragraphs, only one person will get five three paragraphs. right? if you divide uh 15 I mean by by seven. right? So all of the seven members will get two paragraphs, only one all of the six members out of seven will get uh two paragraphs, only one member the seventh member will get three paragraphs. So you will take different parts of the article not that you have to do the presentation on the full article. Of course you will read the whole article but then you will sit in a group and then you will decide who is going to present on which part or on which paragraph. Then you will present the main idea of that specific paragraph or component of the article. And then okay. So since you are going to present only one or two paragraphs so what you are going to do is you are going to take an article from an outside source that you think is relevant to your article. So take two articles from outside source. Now it can be from a book, it can be from an article I mean it can be an article from the internet, it can be from a journal anywhere. but just make sure it's a proper article. So let's say the article that I assign your group with is on climate change alright. So you have to find two more articles on climate change. maybe you can find the article in a book or on the internet or on the book I mean from the books or any websites or any journals anywhere you want. And then you will take relevant information from the article and join it with you know your presentation. add the information from other articles uh to your presentation. Is that clear class? who asked this? I missed out because there are so many like uh faces together. Who asked this? me. It's me. Tahmida. Okay Tahmida. Alright so yes you have to analyze because without analyzing you won't understand the text right? and it's the same for the other two articles that you are going to take right? From the next time I will give attendance just before I mean just 5 minutes before the class ends because I noticed that a lot of people leave after giving the attendance but they don't know that I notice that and I you know mark them absent. if anyone do not send me or email me the reason for his or her leaving. they don't know that I mark them absent. anyway is anyone ready yet? Is anyone ready now? Not yet I guess alright. Keep reading let me know when you are done. you can do a presentation now maybe on one or two paragraphs. you don't have to take the full article the whole article. Done class we don't have much time. Are you still reading? Yes? okay but I cannot see Munim, Nuzhat, Tabassum Bushra. uh then Muhammad Hossain, Mostofa, Shobuj, Istiak at least turn on the camera and let me give you attendance in the meanwhile. Shakib Shadman? I guess absent right? Shakib Shadman? Present ma'am present. Okay present. Istiak? Present ma'am. Yes Present ma'am. Present. Abdullah Sany okay. Mahmuda Tabassum Present ma'am. Okay. anyone ready? So anyone is ready? Are you reading? No ma'am. I'm still reading. Okay. Mahmuda Tabassum? No ma'am I'm also reading still reading. Okay Ifat Sultana what's your update? Uh ma'am I'm still reading too. Shakib Shadman still reading? Yes ma'am still reading. Farhin I cannot see you properly. Okay keep reading let me know when you are done. ",
