## Audio-Only Scenarios
These involve sounds or spoken content that aren't tied to the lesson, often with a static or irrelevant visual (e.g., a paused slide).

1. **Background noises from the environment**: Dogs barking, birds chirping, traffic sounds, construction noise, or household appliances (e.g., vacuum cleaner or washing machine running).
2. **Interruptions from people off-camera**: Family members or colleagues talking in the background, like a spouse asking about dinner or a child interrupting with unrelated questions.
3. **Phone rings or notifications**: Incoming calls, text alerts, email pings, or app notifications sounding during the recording.
4. **Off-topic small talk at the start/end**: Casual conversations like "How's the weather there?" or "Did you watch that game last night?" before diving into the topic or after wrapping up.
5. **Personal anecdotes unrelated to the subject**: Teacher sharing stories about their weekend, pets, or hobbies that don't illustrate an academic point.
6. **Filler words and hesitations**: Excessive "umms," "ahhs," throat clearing, or repeated phrases like "let me think" without progressing the content.
7. **Audio feedback or echoes**: High-pitched squeals from mic feedback, room echoes, or looping sounds from poor setup.
8. **Music or sound effects not tied to content**: Intro/outro music, hold music during breaks, or accidental playback of personal playlists.
9. **Off-topic announcements**: Promotions for unrelated products, events, or services (e.g., "Check out my new book on cooking" in a math class).
10. **Technical troubleshooting audio**: Verbal mutterings like "Why isn't this working?" or "Let me restart the app" while fixing non-academic issues.
11. **Participant chit-chat**: Students or attendees talking among themselves about non-class topics (e.g., weekend plans) if mics are unmuted.
12. **Coughing, sneezing, or bodily sounds**: Unedited health-related noises like heavy breathing, yawning, or sipping drinks loudly.
13. **Door knocks or bells**: Sounds of someone knocking, doorbell ringing, or entering/exiting the room.
14. **Weather or external event commentary**: Sudden remarks like "Oh, it's raining outside" with no relevance.
15. **Accidental recordings of non-class audio**: Pre-class chatter captured before the official start, like the teacher humming or talking on the phone.

## Visual-Only Scenarios
These are on-screen elements or actions with no or minimal audio, often distracting from the core content.

1. **Blank or frozen screens**: Static black/blue screens, loading icons, or frozen frames during transitions.
2. **Irrelevant desktop pop-ups**: Notifications from email, social media, or system updates appearing on the shared screen.
3. **Teacher's personal actions**: Adjusting clothing, fixing hair, eating/drinking, or checking their phone visibly.
4. **Background distractions in the room**: Moving pets, family members walking by, cluttered desks with unrelated items (e.g., toys, food wrappers).
5. **Screen saver activation**: Idle screen savers kicking in during pauses.
6. **Irrelevant slides or visuals**: Accidental display of personal photos, unrelated tabs, or old slides from previous sessions.
7. **Camera adjustments**: Teacher fiddling with the webcam angle, lighting, or background filters mid-recording.
8. **Participant video feeds**: Other attendees' cameras showing off-topic activities, like someone eating or distracted by their phone.
9. **Advertisements or banners**: Pop-up ads, sponsor logos, or platform watermarks that aren't part of the lesson.
10. **Physical interruptions visible**: Delivery person at the door, someone handing the teacher a note or item.
11. **Window views distractions**: Outside scenery like people walking by or traffic, if the camera is pointed that way.
12. **Device reflections or glare**: Screen glare showing reflections of unrelated objects or the teacher's face in a mirror.
13. **Accidental screen shares**: Sharing the wrong window, revealing personal emails, browsers, or files.
14. **Props or objects not in use**: Teacher handling unrelated items like a coffee mug or phone without speaking about them.
15. **Visual glitches**: Pixelation, color distortions, or video lag showing distorted irrelevant frames.

## Audio-Visual Combined Scenarios
These involve both sound and visuals that are synced but off-topic.

1. **Pre-class setup routines**: Teacher testing mic/camera ("Can you hear me?"), adjusting setup, or waiting for participants to join, with visible fidgeting.
2. **Breaks or intermissions**: Announced pauses like "Let's take a 5-minute break," with people chatting, stretching, or screens showing idle chat rooms.
3. **Off-topic Q&A diversions**: Questions from participants about personal life (e.g., "Where did you get that shirt?") and responses, with visible reactions.
4. **Technical glitches and fixes**: Screen freezing while the teacher says "Hold on, let me fix this," showing error messages or rebooting visuals.
5. **Jokes or humor unrelated to topic**: Teacher telling a random joke or meme, with accompanying laughs or visual props (e.g., showing a funny image).
6. **Polls or icebreakers**: Non-academic polls like "What's your favorite food?" with on-screen results and discussion.
7. **End-of-session goodbyes**: Extended farewells like "See you next week, drive safe!" with waving or participant sign-offs visible.
8. **Software loading waits**: Waiting for apps/programs to load, with spinning wheels on screen and verbal comments like "It's loading...".
9. **Participant introductions**: Round-robin "Tell us about yourself" segments focusing on hobbies or jobs, not the subject.
10. **Unrelated demonstrations**: Teacher showing off a gadget or app that's not educational (e.g., "Look at this cool new phone feature").
11. **Echoing participant interruptions**: Someone unmuting to ask about logistics (e.g., "When's the next class?") with their video feed popping up.
12. **Weather/event disruptions**: Sudden storm causing visual flickering (lights out) and audio comments like "Power might go out."
13. **Co-presenter banter**: Multiple hosts chatting about non-work topics, with back-and-forth visuals.
14. **Accidental off-air moments**: Recording continuing after class ends, capturing packing up, casual talk, or leaving the room.
15. **Platform tutorials**: Explaining how to use Zoom/Teams features (e.g., "Click here to raise hand"), with on-screen demos unrelated to academics.
16. **Holiday or event shoutouts**: Greetings like "Happy birthday to John!" with visual confetti effects or claps.
17. **Sales pitches**: Promoting merchandise or unrelated courses, with slides showing links or products.
18. **Emotional or personal vents**: Teacher venting about a bad day, with visible frustration (e.g., sighing, head in hands).
19. **Group activities gone off-track**: Icebreaker games devolving into unrelated stories, with participant videos showing laughter.
20. **Recording errors**: Overlapping audio from previous takes, with mismatched visuals (e.g., teacher mouthing wrong words).

## Silent/Blank Moments
These are pauses with no meaningful audio or visuals, often leading to skipping.

1. **Extended silences during thinking**: Teacher pausing to think or read notes, with a static screen and no sound.
2. **Waiting for responses**: Long waits after asking a question, with blank chat or participant feeds silent.
3. **Transition pauses**: Gaps between slides or topics, with no audio and a frozen image.
4. **Technical delays without commentary**: Silent loading screens or connection lags.
5. **End-of-video dead air**: Trailing silence after the class ends but before the recording stops, with a blank or static visual.
6. **Muted segments**: Accidental muting, leaving only visuals like the teacher gesturing silently.
7. **Blank screen with ambient noise**: No visuals but faint background hum (e.g., fan noise) â€“ though minimal, it's irrelevant.
8. **Post-interruption recovery**: Silent moments after a noise or glitch, as the teacher regroups without speaking.
9. **Idle waiting for late joiners**: Silent screen holding on a welcome slide while waiting for more participants.
10. **Forgotten pauses**: Teacher stepping away briefly, leaving the camera on a empty chair or desk with no sound.

This list covers a wide range of scenarios from common to edge cases, ensuring nothing academic slips in (e.g., I excluded subject-related examples or clarifications). If a video is unedited, these can add up to significant skippable time.
