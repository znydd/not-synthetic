```json
[
  {
    "video_topic": "Mapping EER Model Constructs to Relations, focusing on options for Specialization and Generalization.",
    "segment_description": "The instructor begins the online class by performing a routine audio check to ensure all participants can hear her before starting the lecture.",
    "subtitle": "Okay, hello, can you hear my voice? Yes ma'am.",
    "label": "Irrelevant"
  }
]
```
Rephrase the `video_topic`, `segment_description` and `subtitle` of the given json example and make 10 unique examples of json array
out of it exact same example just rephrase in a really good way. Keep realism and if any subtitle is really large then make it small by
condensing but make it looks like a real subtitle.
