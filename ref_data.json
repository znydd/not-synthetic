This includes discussions about the final exam syllabus, the cancellation of the mid-term exam and its replacement with an assignment, policies on plagiarism, the number of remaining classes, and the grading structure for quizzes. This entire segment is focused on course logistics rather than the academic topic of robotics.",
                "subtitle": "Okay, sure. Yes sir, recording is on. Okay, great. So, I am starting the class. First of all, I want to talk about our syllabus for the final and also there are some announcements that I have to make to you and those announcements are very important for our course. So, as you all know that our mid-term is cancelled. So, we have made some necessary changes so that you don't lose marks from anywhere. So, let's talk about the mid-term first. So first of all, as we are not taking our mid-term in this semester, so what we are planning to do, we will give you an assignment which is basically the mid-term question that we have made for your mid-term examination. So, we will provide the same question to all of you and that will be like an assignment. So, you will have some time to complete that assignment. For example, maybe we will give seven or 10 days to complete that assignment and that assignment will be counted as your mid-term exam. So, a common question can be there that is, as this is a special type of course where you don't have to code, you don't have to make an algorithm for any any type of topic. So, we are expecting that you should write in a different way. Okay? So, I can show you all of the scripts from the previous semester where you can you will always see that there are no similarities between any of the scripts because as you know that our our topic is like that, you you don't have to copy from from anyone and as you are writing from your own perspective, the answer should be different from person to person. Okay? So, if we find that if we find any plagiarism that will be a penalty and maybe you will get zero for that for that specific question. So, that's a very important point and we are expecting that you will not copy from anyone and you you should write from your own. And as you are having the question and you have all of the resources with you, you can take any help from from the resources that I have taught you. So you don't you don't need to copy from anyone. You just need to follow the topics and all of the questions will be will be asked from that topic. So, you you you will easily answer, you can easily answer all of those questions by your own. So, that's the first thing and the second thing is for our final exam, the syllabus is reduced. So, normally in in CSE461 we give we generally give four chapters for for the final exam normally, I'm talking about the normal case. So after we generally give one chapter before mid-term. So, we have two chapters before mid, right? So, out of that those two chapters, we generally give one chapter. So, that chapter should be the first one. But in in this semester, we are omitting this that chapter also. So, you will not be asked any question like before mid-term. So that that before mid-term part is totally removed. And after mid-term, we generally have like three chapters. The one chapter is called navigation and another chapter is control control theory and the last one is machine learning. But considering all of the consequences and the time limitation, we are also omitting one chapter from here. So, instead of three chapters, you will need to study on two chapters. So, we are we are removing basically the machine learning chapter from your syllabus. So, you just you will just have the control theory chapter and the navigation chapter. Okay? So all of these two chapters is very short in in content and generally navigation takes a like two classes to finish and control theory can take two or three three classes. So at most three classes, at least two classes. So it it depends on how much topic we can cover in one class. So generally it takes three three classes. So in total you will need to attend like three five sessions. So out of those five sessions, you will easily cover the syllabus that you have to study for your final exam. Okay? So that's all and and also I will give some uh one or two assignments before before the final exam. that is not basically the mid-term exam mid-term assignment. It's a separate assignment and I will provide it to you because we have a we have a specific amount of marks for for the assignments. So we need to cover that that that part also. So that's why I will give you one or two assignments before before the final. So that's all and and also another important point is you you will need to sit for two quizzes for before final. So one quiz will be uh will be on um navigation and another quiz will be on control theory. And as you have already given one uh quiz before mid-term and you will also have to face two quizzes after mid-term that is basically before final. So in total you you will need to give like three quizzes, right? But according to the departmental notice, we need to consider best n minus two uh n minus two count. So in total as we have uh like three three quizzes so n minus two is basically one. So we will consider best one quizzes out of three. Okay? So that's a huge uh I think that's a huge advantage for you for all of you. So you just need to make sure that you are getting enough mark at least at one at one quiz. Okay? So that's all and all of the mark distributions are similar like like our previous semester. But we we we were planning to take your final exam on out of 40 marks but then we realized that uh for 40 marks is huge for your final exam and as you have a short shorter version of syllabus, so 40 marks will be assigning assigning questions for 40 marks will be difficult for us also. So that's why we decided that we will uh take your exam uh we will take your final exam out of 30 or 35 marks. Okay? So that's that's all I I think that's all for uh for the announcement part. So if you have any question regarding any of the topics you can ask."

It's going to be a webinar presentation and um hopefully it won't be that difficult for you because you have already done one presentation in a group. Uh we are going to look at buX first and see how it works. Then I will tag you um you know I will I will tag you in groups and I will also assign you um with an article. Each group will be assigned with one article. So let me share buX first. Let me share my screen. I hope all of you can see it. Uh so first let's watch the lecture video on webinar."

But when the pandemic hit, everything went online, you know it can it's it's our classes, offices, other organizations, institutions so everything went online and of course people had to uh you know conduct seminars and everything. So when you know people started uh conducting seminars online, uh then we call it uh you know webinars. So it's a platform that serves the purpose of holding various events or video presentations, training sessions, classes, workshops etc. alright. So it's it's a picture, it's just like uh it's just like us what we do in in a in an online class, right?"

Then you will see there are four articles on buX and I will assign one article to each group. Then, every participant will present the different main ideas or components of the article. So let's say this is a long article, right? This is probably an article of let's say 10 or 15 paragraphs, alright because the length of the article will vary. You you will see that. So you are not going to since it's a group presentation so not that everybody is going to do the presentation on the whole article. We you will follow a special reading strategy that is called jigsaw strategy. So in jigsaw strategy what we do is there are group there are group members in one group right? So you will divide the long text or the long article into chunks or parts. Then each group member will take only one part or one chunk of the article. So let's say if there are since there are 25 students, so there are going to be six students in one group. Only one group will have seven students. So let's say if there are 15 paragraphs then you can divide the paragraphs by like this. Like one person will present on two paragraphs. So if there are 15 paragraphs then you know if there are seven group members then each of them will get two paragraphs, only one person will get five three paragraphs. right? if you divide uh 15 I mean by by seven. right? So all of the seven members will get two paragraphs, only one all of the six members out of seven will get uh two paragraphs, only one member the seventh member will get three paragraphs. So you will take different parts of the article not that you have to do the presentation on the full article. Of course you will read the whole article but then you will sit in a group and then you will decide who is going to present on which part or on which paragraph. Then you will present the main idea of that specific paragraph or component of the article. And then okay. So since you are going to present only one or two paragraphs so what you are going to do is you are going to take an article from an outside source that you think is relevant to your article. So take two articles from outside source. Now it can be from a book, it can be from an article I mean it can be an article from the internet, it can be from a journal anywhere. but just make sure it's a proper article. So let's say the article that I assign your group with is on climate change alright. So you have to find two more articles on climate change. maybe you can find the article in a book or on the internet or on the book I mean from the books or any websites or any journals anywhere you want. And then you will take relevant information from the article and join it with you know your presentation. add the information from other articles uh to your presentation. Is that clear class? who asked this? I missed out because there are so many like uh faces together. Who asked this? me. It's me. Tahmida. Okay Tahmida. Alright so yes you have to analyze because without analyzing you won't understand the text right? and it's the same for the other two articles that you are going to take right? From the next time I will give attendance just before I mean just 5 minutes before the class ends because I noticed that a lot of people leave after giving the attendance but they don't know that I notice that and I you know mark them absent. if anyone do not send me or email me the reason for his or her leaving. they don't know that I mark them absent. anyway is anyone ready yet? Is anyone ready now? Not yet I guess alright. Keep reading let me know when you are done. you can do a presentation now maybe on one or two paragraphs. you don't have to take the full article the whole article. Done class we don't have much time. Are you still reading? Yes? okay but I cannot see Munim, Nuzhat, Tabassum Bushra. uh then Muhammad Hossain, Mostofa, Shobuj, Istiak at least turn on the camera and let me give you attendance in the meanwhile. Shakib Shadman? I guess absent right? Shakib Shadman? Present ma'am present. Okay present. Istiak? Present ma'am. Yes Present ma'am. Present. Abdullah Sany okay. Mahmuda Tabassum Present ma'am. Okay. anyone ready? So anyone is ready? Are you reading? No ma'am. I'm still reading. Okay. Mahmuda Tabassum? No ma'am I'm also reading still reading. Okay Ifat Sultana what's your update? Uh ma'am I'm still reading too. Shakib Shadman still reading? Yes ma'am still reading. Farhin I cannot see you properly.

I don't expect you to understand but it's pretty easy once we go through the contents, things get a bit familiar when we do a live session, okay? So go through the lecture of the contents we've gone through today. And then study a bit of circular array. And then there's a very important thing you must do, that is, if you think, if you think you lack knowledge on objects and classes, if you're not 100% sure that you know objects and classes, make sure you know them, okay? These were taught in the previous course CSE111. And objects and classes, understanding objects and classes are vital for CSE220. If you don't understand objects and classes 100%, you won't make it through 220, okay? Because once we're done with the arrays, we're going to move into a very, a bit, I wouldn't say complicated, I'll say a bit advanced data structures that involves only classes and objects. So if you're not sure what classes and objects are, how they work, you're going to be in very big trouble. So make sure you know these. And yeah, if you, if you go to Slack, I've given a link and there's a book. I want you guys to read books, okay? And by next week I think you'll you'll be assigned a student tutor. So if you have lackings, if you have questions on previous courses, please talk to him or her, I mean, at the earliest convenience. Don't delay it for midterm or final. The major reason why why students do not go through 220 is because of objects and classes. They know arrays, they know lists, but about 80% of 220 is covered by these two things, okay? Please keep this in mind. Any more questions? Do you have any more questions? If not, then we'll end today. Uh, sir, when will our lab sessions start? We're supposed to have one tomorrow. From from next week. Next week? Okay. Right, thank you, sir. Sir, for our quizzes and assignments, do we have to use Java or Python? This is an option. You can use either Java or Python but I suggest you learn both the languages. Learn both the languages. Thank you, sir. Sir, since this is, I think this is the first semester where we're doing Java, so could you differentiate some of the differences between Java and Python? That would be very helpful. Python is more of a high level than Java. Both are high level languages but Python is a bit more high level. High level means easier, less complicated than Java. So according to me, if you're start, if you're starting to learn a programming language, you should go for C or Java, you know. So when you use Python, Python's very easy. A lot of things you don't need to think. But while, but while programming in Java or C, you need to think a lot. So at the very beginning, I think thinking is a good thing, you know. Spending time, but still in this course it's an option. You can go for either Java or Python, it's your wish. But I suggest you learn both the languages. Thank you, sir. Okay then, goodbye. All right, bye sir. Thank you sir. Bye sir. Thank you sir. Thank you sir. Have a great day."

Okay, so I think it will be better if we can just take the quiz on TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS method. Specifically, those methods are easy to calculate and also, we have a plan to do some research work on those topics. So next week, on the 12th of this month, at the beginning of the class, we will have a quiz on TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS methods. So, this is the announcement."
